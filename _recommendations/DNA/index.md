    Allele: a series of variants on one chromosome.
    Complex: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a range of changes occur that can not be described as one of the basic variant types (substitution, deletion, duplication, insertion, conversion, inversion, deletion-insertion, or repeated sequence).
    Conversion: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a <b>range of nucleotides</b> are replaced by a sequence from <b>elsewhere</b> in the genome.
    Deletion: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are not present (deleted).
    Deletion/Insertion: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are replaced by one or more other nucleotides and <b>which is not</b> a substitution, inversion or conversion.<br> <b><i>NOTE</i></b>; when one nucleotide is replaced by one other nucleotide the change is called a substitution
    Duplication: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a copy of one or more nucleotides are inserted <b>directly 3'</b> of the original copy of that sequence.<br> <b><i>NOTE</i></b>; when the copied sequence is not inserted directly 3'-flanking of the original copy the change is called an insertion
    Insertion: a sequence change where, compared to the reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are inserted <b>and</b> where the insertion is not a copy of a sequence immediately 5'.
    Inversion: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, <b>more than one nucleotide</b> replacing the original sequence are the reverse complement of the original sequence.
    Repeated sequence: a sequence where, compared to a reference sequence, a segment of <b>one or more nucleotides</b> (the repeat unit) is present several times, one after the other.
    Substitution: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, <b>one</b> nucleotide is replaced by <b>one</b> other nucleotide.<br> <b><i>NOTE</i></b>; a sequence change where one nucleotide is replaced by more than one other nucleotide is a deletion-insertion (indel)<br> <b><i>NOTE</i></b>; a sequence change where more than one nucleotide is replaced by one or more other nucleotide is a deletion-insertion (indel)
    Translocation: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, the sequence of one chromosome at the so called breakpoint (or junction) changes to that of another chromosome.<br> <b><i>NOTE</i></b>; a translocation occurs when 2 chromosomes break and the fragments rejoin to the another broken chromosome. A full description of a (reciprocal) translocation consists of 2 parts, one describing the first junction, the second describing the other junction (e.g. the chromosome 4;X junction as well as the chromosome X;4 junction)
    Transposition: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a range of nucleotides move from one position to another position, i.e. a deletion at one positions combined with the insertion of the deleted sequence at another position
