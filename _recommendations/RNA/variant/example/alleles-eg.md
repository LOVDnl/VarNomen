*	r.[76a>c;103del]
	: the transcript of one allele (chromosome) of a gene contains two changes, r.76a>c and r.103del. The variants are found **in cis**.
*	r.[76a>c];[103del]
	: the transcripts of each allele (chromosomes) of a gene each contain a different change, r.76a>c and r.103del. A **heterozygous** case (compound heterozygote, e.g. in a recessive disease). The variants are found **in trans**.
*	r.[76a>c];[76a>c]
	: the transcripts of both alleles (chromosomes) of a gene contain the same variant, r.76a>c. A **homozygous** case (e.g. in a recessive disease).
*	r.[76a>c(;)103del]
	: the transcripts of a gene contain two variants, r.76a>c and r.103del, but it is not known whether they are on the same or on different transcripts.
*	r.[76a>c(;)76a>c]
	: analysis detects one variant (r.76a>c), suggesting both transcripts contain this variant but it can not be excluded the other transcript is not detected.
*	r.[76a>c];[76A=]
	: the transcript of one allele (chromosome) of a gene contains a variant, r.76a>c, the transcript of the other allele (chromosome) contains the reference sequence, r.76= (is **wild-type**).
*	r.[76a>c];[?]
	: the transcript of one allele (chromosome) of a gene contains a variant, r.76a>c, while a variant in the transcript of the other allele is expected but not yet identified (r.?) (e.g. in individuals affected by a recessive disease).
*	r.[266c>g;476c>u;1083g>c];r.[266c>g;1083g>c]
	: the transcripts of a gene contain variants r.266c>g and r.1083g>c on both alleles and variant r.476c>u on only one transcript.
