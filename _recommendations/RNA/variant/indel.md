title: deletion/ insertion (indel)
definition: 
    Deletion-Insertion (indel): a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are replaced by one or more other nucleotides <b>and which is not</b> a substitution, inversion or conversion.
discussion:
    What is an <b>"indel"</b>?: An "indel", <b>deletion/insertion</b> in HGVS nomenclature, is a variant which is a combination of a deletion and an insertion. Based on existing nomeclature, the variant can be described as a deletion and insertion occuring at the same position, using the format r.112_117delinsug.
    Can I describe a gc to ug variant as a dinucleotide substitution (r.4gc>ug)?: No this is not allowed. By definition a substitution changes <b>one</b> nucleotide into <b>one</b> other nucleotide (<a href='http://www.HGVS.org/varnomen/recommendations/RNA/variant/substitution/'><i>see Substitution</i></a>). The change ugu<font color="red">gc</font>ca to ugu<font color="red">ug</font>ca should be described as r.4_5delinsug, i.e. a deletion/insertion (indel).
