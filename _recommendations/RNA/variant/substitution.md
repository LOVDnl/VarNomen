title: substitution
definition:
    Substitution: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, <b>one</b> nucleotide is replaced by <b>one</b> other nucleotide.
discussion:
    Are ploymorphisms described like r.76a/u?: No, all substitutions are described as r.76a>u. In the past, the format r.76a/g has been used to describe frequent ("polymorphic") sequence variants. A description should however be neutral, simply describe the change, and not include any other information like predicted or known functional consequences.
    Can I describe a gc to ug variant as a dinucleotide substitution (r.4gcC>ug)?: No this is not allowed. By definition a substitution changes <b>one</b> nucleotide into <b>one</b> other nucleotide. The change ugugcca to ugu**<font color="red">ug</font>**ca should be described as a deletion/insertion (indel) as r.4_5delinsug.
