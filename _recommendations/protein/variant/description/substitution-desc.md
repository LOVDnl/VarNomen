Format:   **"prefix""amino_acid_substituted""position""new_amino_acid"**,  e.g. p.Ser45Arg

**"prefix"**  =  reference sequence used  =  p.<br>
**"amino_acid_substituted"**  =  amino acid sustituted  =  Ser<br>
**"position"**  =  amino acid position =  45<br>
**"new-amino-acid"**  =  new amino acid  =  Arg

### Notes

*	**prefix** reference sequence accepted is p. (protein).
*	changes involving two or more consecutive amino acids are described as deletion/insertions (indels) ([_see Deletion/insertion (indel)_](/recommendations/protein/variant/indel/)).
*	 **nonsense** variants are a special type of amino acid deletion, introducing an immediate translation termination (stop), described as an amino acid substitution (p.Trp26Ter or p.Trp26*)
*	variants in the ATG translation initiation codon are not described as a substitution, they give no protein ("p.0"), an N-terminal deletion ([_see Deletion_](/recommendations/protein/variant/deletion/)) or an extension ([_see Deletion_](/recommendations/protein/variant/extension/))
*	the description p.Thr76\_Cys77delinsAsnPro is preferred over p.[Thr76Asn;Cys77Pro]  
	*	**NOTE:** by definition this change can not be described as a substitution (like c.Thr76\_Cys77>AsnPro)
*	it is not correct to describe a frequent variant ("polymorphism") as p.45Arg/Ser.
