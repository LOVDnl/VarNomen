    Allele: a series of variants on one chromosome.
discussion:
    Was originally the recommendation to use the format [p.Gln76Lys+p.Met83Val]?: Indeed, originally <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291098-1004%28200001%2915:1%3c7::AID-HUMU4%3e3.0.CO;2-N">den Dunnen and Antonarakis, 2000</a> the suggestion was to describe two changes in a gene on one chromosome as [p.Gln76Lys+p.Met83Val], i.e. using a "+"-character to separate the two changes, while an earlier publication suggested to use a ";" (p.[Gln76Lys;Met83Val] <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291098-1004%281998%2911:1%3c1::AID-HUMU1%3e3.0.CO;2-O">(Antonarakis and the Nomenclature Working Group, 1998</a>). To prevent confusion with older publications, to improve overall consistency and to keep descriptions as short as possible, the 2000 proposal was retracted. The recommended format is p.[Gln76Lys;Met83Val].
    In recessive diseases, is it important I show which variants were found in which combination?: When in one individual you find more then one variant it is essential that you clearly indicate which variant(s) were found and on which allele(s);<ul><li>disease severity will depend on the combination of variants found,</li><li>in recessive disease, when two variants are on one allele an individual is a carrier or you might not have found the variant on the 2nd allele.</li></ul>
    I find the notation p.[Gln76Lys] without describing the second allele misleading; not enough researchers know this refers to only one of the two alleles present. Would using p.[Gln76Lys];[] be OK?: No, the recommended description is p.[Gln76Lys];[Gln76=], i.e. p.Gln76= for "no change" on the second allele. 
    How should I describe the variants detected in males and females for a gene on the X-chromosome?: In <b>females</b> the description is straightforward, like p.[Gln76Lys];[Gln76=]. In <b>males</b> there is no second allele (X-chromosome) which can be described as p.[Gln76Lys];[0], i.e. using "<b>p.0</b>" to indicate the absence of a second X-chromosome.
