definition: 
    Deletion: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more amino acids are not present (deleted).
discussion:
    Can I use p.Glu123del6 to describe a 6 amino acid deletion?: No, a deletion of more than one amino acid should list the first and last amino acid deleted, separated using the range symbol ("_", underscore), e.g. p.Glu123_Pro128del and not p.Glu123del6.
