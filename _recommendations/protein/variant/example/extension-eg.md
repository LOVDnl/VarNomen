*	p.Met1ext-5
	:	a variant activating a new upstream translation initiation site starting with amino acid Met-5 (Methionine -5)
	:	_**NOTE**_: the description can only be given when experimental evidence shows activation of the upstream translation initiation site (excluding activation of a downstream initiation site or the total absence of protein)
	:	_**NOTE**_: since the translation initiation codon is not affected the description is not p.Met1Metext-5
*	p.Met1Valext-12
	:	amino acid Met1 is changed to Val activating an upstream translation initiation site at position -12 (Methionine -12)
	:	_**NOTE**_: the description can only be given when experimental evidence shows activation of the upstream translation initiation site (excluding activation of a downstream initiation site or the total absence of protein)
*	p.Ter110GlnextTer17 (or p.*110Glnext\*17)
	:	a variant in the translation termination (stop) codon at position 110, changing it to a codon for Glutamine (Gln) and adding a tail of new amino acids to the protein's C-terminus ending at a new stop codon (Ter17/\*17)
*	p.Ter327ArgextTer? (or p.*327Argext*?)
	:	a variant in the translation termination (stop) codon at position 327, changing it to a codon for Arginine (Arg) and adding a tail of new amino acids of unknown length since the new reading frame does not contain a new stop codon.
