Duplications are designated by _**"dup"**_ after a description of the duplicated segment, i.e. the first (and last) amino acid(s) duplicated.

*	p.Gln8dup
	:	amino acid Gln8 is duplicated, changing MKLGHQQQCC to MKLGHQQQ**<font color="red">Q</font>**CC
	:	_**NOTE**_: the 3'rule determines that the most 3' residue is arbitrarily assigned to have been duplicated
*	p.Gly4_Gln6dup
	:	amino acids Gly4 to Gln6 are duplicated, changing MKLGHQQQCC to MKLGHQ**<font color="red">GHQ</font>**QQCC

*   p.Gly4_Gln6dup in the sequence MKMGHQQQCC denotes a duplication of amino acids Glycine-4 (Gly, G) to Glutamine-6 (Gln, Q) (i.e. MKMGHQ**<u>GHQ</u>**QQCC)
*   duplicating insertions in single amino acid stretches (or short tandem repeats) are described as a duplication, e.g. a duplicating HQ insertion in the HQ-tandem repeat sequence of MKMGHQHQCC to MKMGHQHQ**<u>HQ</u>**CC is described as p.His7_Gln8dup (not p.Gln8_Cys9insHisGln)
