*	p.[(Ala25Thr;Gly28Val)]
	: the protein of one allele (chromosome) of a gene contains two predicted changes, p.[(Ala25Thr)] and p.[(Gly28Val)]. The variants are found **in cis**.
	:	_**NOTE**_: the description p.**<font color="red">(</font>**[Ala25Thr];[Gly28Val]**<font color="red">)</font>** should not be used
*	p.[(Ala25Thr)];[(Gly28Val)]
	: the proteins of each allele (chromosomes) of a gene each contain different predicted changes, p.[(Ala25Thr)] and p.[(Gly28Val)]. A **heterozygous** case (compound heterozygote, e.g. in a recessive disease). The variants are found **in trans**.
*	p.[(Ala25Thr)];[(Ala25Thr)]
	: the proteins of both alleles (chromosomes) of a gene contain the same predicted variant, p.[(Ala25Thr)]. A **homozygous** case (e.g. in a recessive disease).
*	p.[(Ala25Thr(;)Pro103del)]
	: the proteins of a gene contain two predicted variants, p.[(Ala25Thr)] and p.[(Pro103del)], but it is not known whether they are in the same or in different proteins.
*	p.[(Pro103del)(;)(Pro103del)]
	: analysis detects one predicted variant (p.(Pro103del)), suggesting both proteins contain this variant but it can not be excluded the other protein is not detected.
*	p.[(Ala25Thr)];[Ala25=]
	: the protein of one allele (chromosome) of a gene contains predicted variant p.(Ala25Thr), the protein of the other allele (chromosome) contains the reference sequence, p.(Ala25=) (is **wild-type**).
*	p.[(Ala25Thr)];[(?)]
	: the protein of one allele (chromosome) of a gene contains predicted variant p.(Ala25Thr), while a variant in the protein of the other allele is expected but not yet identified (p.?) (e.g. in individuals affected by a recessive disease).
*	p.[(Ala25Thr;Gly28Val;Pro103del)];r.[266c>g;Pro103del)]
	: the proteins of a gene both contain predicted variants p.(Ala25Thr) and p.(Pro103del) and predicted variant p.(Gly28Val) in only one protein.
