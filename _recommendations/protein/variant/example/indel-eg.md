*	in-frame
	*	p.Cys28\_Lys29delinsTrp
	:	amino acids Cys28 to Lys29 are deleted and replaced by a Trp (e.g. as a consequence of a 3 nucleotide deletion) 
	*	p.Cys28delinsTrpVal
	:	 amino acid Cys28 is deleted and replaced by amino acids Trp and Val (e.g. as a consequence of a 3 nucleotide insertion) 
	*	p.(Pro578\_Lys579delinsLeuTer)
	:	amino acids Pro578 to Lys579 are deleted and replaced by amino acids Leu and a translation stop codon (Ter) (the predicted change resulting from NM_080877.2:c.1733_1735delinsTTT (SLC43A)
		*	p.(Pro578_Gln598del)
		:	amino acids Pro578 to Gln598 are deleted (the predicted change resulting from NM_080877.2:c.1732_1794del (SLC34A3)
		:	_**NOTE**_: although the proteins resulting from these two changes are identical, their HGVS description is different.
*	frame shifts
	*	p.Arg97fs
	:	a frame shift starting with amino acid Arg97 as first altered amino acid
	:	_**NOTE**_: description using the <u>short format</u>
	*	p.Glu5ValfsTer5 (p.Glu5Valfs*5)
	:	a frame shift starting with amino acid change Gly5 to Val and termination at position Ter5 (*5)
	*	p.(Asp2MetfsTer4)
	:	the predicted consequence of c.4delG changing ATG**G**ATG-CAT-ACG-TGA-CG to ATG_ <u>ATGCATACGTGA</u>CG.
	*	p.(Glu5ValfsTer5)
	:	the predicted consequence of c.6\_13dup changing ATGGA**TGCATACG**AGATGAGG to ATGGA**TGCATAC<u>-GTG-CAT-ACG**-AGATGA</u>GG.
	*	p.His150HisfsTer10
	:	this description is **not correct**, the first amino acid listed is **not changed**, p.Gln151ThrfsTer9 is correct.
