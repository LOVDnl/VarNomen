*	missense variant
	*	p.Trp26Cys
	:	amino acid Tp26 is changed to Cys
	*	p.Met1Val
	:	is not correct, a change affecting the ATG translation initiation codon gives no protein ("p.0"), an N-terminal deletion ([_see Deletion_](/recommendations/protein/variant/deletion/)) or an extension ([_see Extension_](/recommendations/protein/variant/extension/))
		*   p.Met1?
		:	amino acid Met-1 (ATG translation initiation site) is changed but the consequence can not be predicted
		*	p.0
		:	no protein produced, e.g. as a consequence of a change in the ATG translation initiation codon (experimental data should be available) or a variant deleting the promoter/first exon
		*	p.(0?)
        :	the predicted consequence is that no protein is produced.
	*   p.Ter1834Arg
	:	is not correct, a change affecting the translation termination (stop) codon is an extension ([_see Extension_](/recommendations/protein/variant/extension/))
*	nonsense variant 
	*	p.Trp26Ter  (p.Trp26\*)
	:	amino acid Trp26 is changed to a translation termination (stop) codon
	:	_**NOTE**_: the description does not include the deletion at protein level of the entire C-terminal amino acid sequence (like p.Trp26\_Leu1833del)
*	silent
	*	p.Leu36=
	:	amino acid Leu36 was analysed but not changed
	:	_**NOTE**_: a variant might be present at the DNA level but it does not change the encoded amino acid
	:	_**NOTE**_: silent variants should not be described as p.Leu36Leu or p.36Leu/Leu
