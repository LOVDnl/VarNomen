title: substitution
definition: 
    Substitution: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, <b>one</b> amino acid is replaced by <b>one</b> other amino acid.
discussion:
    Variants in the translation initiating ATG are often described as a substitution, e.g. p.Met1Val. Is this correct?: No, when Met1 changes translation initiation is no longer possible. Either no protein is produced (p.0) or a new translation initiation site upstream (<i><a href= 'http://www.HGVS.org/varnomen/recommendations/protein/variant/extension/'>an extension</a></i>) or downstream (<i><a href= 'http://www.HGVS.org/varnomen/recommendations/protein/variant/deletion/'>a deletion</a></i>) is used. Unless experimental evidence is available, it is probably best to report the effect on protein level as "p.?" (unknown).
    When a change is common and well characterised at RNA and protein level, such as CFTR:p.Phe508del, is it still necessary to give the description in parentheses? (<i>Richard Barber</i>): When you have to report what your test detected it seems best to be precise and use p.(Phe508del). In addition, be careful the evidence suggested is indeed available and do not fall into the trap of "transitive proof", i.e. reports only referring to another source for experimental evidence without actually adding additional evidence.
