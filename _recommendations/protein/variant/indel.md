title: deletion/ insertion (indel) 
definition: 
    Deletion-Insertion (indel): a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more amino acids are replaced by one or more other amino acids <b>and which is not</b> a substitution or conversion.
discussion:
    Can we describe the consequences of a G duplication at DNA level causing a frameshift where the shifted frame does not encounter a new stop codon as p.Ile327Argfs (we expect the protein is not formed since the aberrant RNA will be degraded lacking a stop codon). (<i>Giampaolo Trivellin, London</i>): When you expect the RNA is degraded it is probably best to describe the predicted change as "p.?" or as "p.0?". When a reading frame does not encounter a new translation termination (stop) codon this is described as "fsTer?", in your example p.(Ile327Arg<b>fs*?</b>).
    When a protein description does not contain "fs" (frame shift) does this mean there is no frame shift?: By definition, yes. Examples of what some might call frame shift variants which are not described as frame shifts include (i) a deletion yielding an immediate stop codon (ATGCTGAGC to ATG_TGAGC giving p.(Cys2Ter)), (ii) a deletion giving a frame shift which, before a stop codon is encountered, is followed by another variant shifting the reading frame back to normal (described as a deletion-insertion), (iii) the deletion of a nucleotide from the translation termination codon, extending the C-terminus of the encoded protein (<i><a href='http://www.HGVS.org/varnomen/recommendations/protein/variant/extension/'>see Extensions</a></i>). Since technically there is no reading frame after the translation termination codon there is also <b>no shifted frame</b>.
