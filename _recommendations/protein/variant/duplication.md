title: duplication
definition: 
    Duplication: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a copy of one or more amino acids are inserted <b>directly 3'</b> of the original copy of that sequence.
discussion:
     Why do we not describe a duplication as an insertion?: Although duplications are basically a special type of insertion, there are several reasons why the recommendation is to describe duplications independently from insertions;<ul><li>the description is simple and shorter,</il><li>it is clear and prevents confusion regarding the position when an insertion is incorrectly reported like "p.Ala22insPro",</li><li>insertion more or less means "coming from elsewhere". Mechanistically, a duplication is most likely caused by a local event, DNA polymerase slippage, duplicating a local sequence.</li></ul>.
